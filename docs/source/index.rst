RAPID Image-Difference Pipeline Documentation
####################################################

Welcome! This is the documentation for the RAPID Image-Difference
Pipeline, under development at IPAC/Caltech.


.. note::
   Development of source code and documentation is currently ongoing.


Running the Latest RAPID Pipeline
*************************************

A Docker image has been pre-built from a recent git-clone of the RAPID Github
repository (5/5/25).
This Docker image offers the convenience of having the RAPID
pipeline already installed and ready to run.  It is publicly available from

.. code-block::

   public.ecr.aws/y9b1s7h8/rapid_science_pipeline:latest

It is currently 3.34GB in size, and requires sufficient disk space on the target machine.
It can be used to ``docker-run`` a container and from within execute
code for image-differencing, etc., using a ``docker-run`` command like the
following (note that an entry point to bash is required for interactive use
and to inhibit running the automated pipeline):

.. code-block::

   docker run -it --entrypoint bash --name my_test -v /home/ubuntu/work/test_20241206:/work public.ecr.aws/y9b1s7h8/rapid_science_pipeline:latest


The Docker file used to generate this Docker image is

.. code-block::

   rapid/docker/Dockerfile_ubuntu_runSingleSciencePipeline

in the RAPID git repo.  The Docker image self-contains a
RAPID git-clone in the /code directory (no volume binding to an
external filesystem containing the RAPID git repo is necessary).  The
Docker image also contains a
C-code build of the RAPID software stack with the following run-time environment:

.. code-block::

   export PATH=/code/c/bin:/root/.local/bin:/root/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/code/c/lib



Getting the Source Code
*****************************

Please refer to the `RAPID GitHub Repository <https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/rapid>`_ for the source code.

..
   Separate file for installation of the pipeline and building the C code.
